"We’re always breathing, yet we’re mostly unaware of its tremendous potential. Heightened oxygen levels hold a treasure trove of benefits, and the specialized breathing technique of the Wim Hof Method unearths them all: more energy, reduced stress levels, and an augmented immune response that swiftly deals with pathogens."
This program tracks the progress of people who want to practice the Wim Hof Method for breathework.

I made program for my CMPT220 class at Marist College before I transfered.
